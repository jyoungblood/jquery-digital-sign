# jQuery Digital Sign

This is a straightfoward solution for "quick and easy" digital signage that can be built with common web technology. Throw these files on any web server, point your sign's browser at it and you're good to go.

- built w/ jquery & tachyons - easy construction/use/extendability
	- very simple construction - easy to understand what it's doing, easy to modify (if you know basic web dev)
- automatic page transitions (dissolves between)
- arrow paging
- boilerplate / base (default page, css, js)
